# AnnePro-mac

# Known problems
- Uploading new lighting and layout information will sometimes stop halfway through. Currently the layout code will
  retry until the keyboard has the correct layout, but the lighting will not.
  
These issues are probably related to my inexperiece with the CoreBluetooth library, and creating macOS applications in general.
Please leave a pull request if you know how to fix these issues.
